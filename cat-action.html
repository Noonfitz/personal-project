<h1>8 Steps to Recovering a Lost Cat</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Search every nook and cranny of your house and grounds</li>
    <p>First, make sure your cat is really no longer in the house! Maybe your cat has become trapped someplace or is hiding because it is sick or injured. Do not assume your cat will meow or come to you. Look in closets, drawers, air ducts, behind appliances, 
        under beds, in the hollow under reclining chairs, behind books in a bookcase, wrapped in the bottom of drapes, in any hidden recesses, basement crawl spaces, in sheds, garages, under decks, in pipes and culverts, dumpsters, garbage cans, in trees, on rooftops...
        <span>Cats also have an unfortunate tendency to explore new places, like the back of pick-up trucks and they often get accidentally carried off. Consider whether there were any vehicles around that your cat may have hitched a ride on.</span></p>
    <li>Notify your local animal control agency or the police. If your cat has a chip, let the microchip company know your cat has gone missing.</li>
    <p>Police or animal control are often the first place people call when they have found a stray pet in their neighborhood. Ask that they keep a written record of your lost pet.</p>
    <li>Comb the neighborhood on foot and by car as soon as possible and keep looking. Get permission and check all yards within a five house radius. Bring a carrier.</li>
    <p>Calmly call your cat by name or make some familiar and attractive noise, like rustling a food bag, or shaking a can of treats. Remember that a frightened or injured cat will hide and may not come to you. Pause often and listen. Look under porches, behind bushes, under cars, etc. 
        Ask neighbors for permission to look in their yards. Most cats are recovered close to home. Another possibility is that your cat has become trapped in a neighbor's garage or shed or on a construction site.
        Look also in trees and on rooftops. Bring a flashlight to examine dark places. The best time to look and call is early morning and late evening when there is not much activity. Take along a photograph of your pet to show neighbors and people who know the area: letter carriers,
         meter readers, school bus drivers, joggers, neighborhood children. Hand out cards or flyers with a picture and information on how to contact you. Most cats won’t go too far, and are probably hiding close by. 
        Go out after dark with a flashlight. Shine the flashlight up onto rooftops as well as down into all hidden recesses and look for the distinctive reflection from the eyes.</p>
    <li>Scour lost and found cat information on the web!</li>
        <dd>-Search the Found Cat reports on Pet FBI and post a Lost Cat report.</dd>
        <dd>-Post and keep checking reports on Craigslist</dd>
        <dd>-On Facebook: Create a blast from your page! Also research lost and found pet Facebook pages and post.</dd>
        <dd>-Other web based resources: "pet recovery services"</dd>
    <br>
    <li>Create and post flyers</li>
    <p>Include a picture and description of the animal, date lost, and how to contact you. This is one of the most successful techniques. Be sure the letters are large and easily visible from a passing car. For your convenience, we have prepared a flyer template <a href="#">Flyer template</a>. You can click on this 
        link, key in your information and it will automatically format a printable flyer. Have copies of your flyer made on light, bright colored paper. Include a photo if possible. In addition to printing and posting as many flyers as is practical, we recommend that you make a few special posters to use in the 
        most strategic places. Mount some of your flyers on fluorescent poster board. Use an indelible marker to write LOST CAT, and your phone number in large dark letters and put sheet protectors on your flyer. (Most supermarkets sell poster board in the school supply aisle)
    </p>
    <li>Try to attract your pet back to the house.</li>
    <p>In our experience, many cats make their way back home eventually - sometimes long after they have gone missing. Here are some tips to lure them back home: Cats are comforted by their own scent. Put your cat's favorite bed, blanket, or cat tree outside. Set out fragrant food, taking care that other animals don’t 
        eat it. If at all possible and/or safe and practical, leave a window or a door open so your cat can get back in on their own time.</p>
    <li>Consider setting a humane trap.</li>
    <p>Once you confirm the cat is around but resists coming to you, you may need to try trapping with a humane trap. Inside cats that “escape” to the outdoors are very likely to be hiding close by. Their instinct when frightened is not to reveal themselves, so they will not meow or come to you. The only way to get a nervous cat back may be to trap it. Some local humane societies and animal control agencies will lend or rent humane traps. They can also be purchased at pet stores, hardware stores and home centers. Bait with some strong-smelling food. Monitor trap often. If left overnight, do not be surprised if you catch a raccoon or someone else’s cat!</p>
    <li> Visit local shelters and humane societies immediately and return often.</li>
    <p>This is the hardest thing to do, both physically and psychologically. In most states there is no mandated holding period for cats as there is for dogs. You may have to look at all those little faces knowing they could be doomed. Of course there are shelters that do not routinely euthanize but they are usually full and have to turn down people who want to surrender a stray. Still it is indispensable to visit your local shelters in person to see if your cat has been turned in. Bring a good photograph of your pet to leave with them. but do not depend on the shelter people to contact you. Often, they are just too overwhelmed to research the huge volume of lost and found cat reports they are asked to deal with. You really need to return to the shelters regularly to look for yourself.</p>
